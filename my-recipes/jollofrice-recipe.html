            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare Ingredients: Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Finely chop the onion, bell peppers, garlic, and Scotch bonnet peppers. If using meat or shrimp, cook them separately and set aside.</li>
                <li>Saute Vegetables: In a large pot or skillet, heat the vegetable oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they are soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Then, add the minced garlic, chopped bell peppers, and Scotch bonnet peppers. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Add Tomatoes and Tomato Paste: Stir in the chopped tomatoes or tomato puree and tomato paste. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have reduced and the mixture thickens slightly.</li>
                <li>Seasoning: Add the thyme, curry powder, paprika, dried thyme, salt, and pepper to the tomato mixture. Stir well to combine, allowing the flavors to meld for a minute or two.</li>
                <li>Add Rice and Broth: Add the rinsed rice to the pot, stirring to coat it evenly with the tomato mixture. Then, pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, ensuring that the rice is submerged in liquid.</li>
                <li>Cook Rice: Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let the rice simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Avoid stirring the rice too much to prevent it from becoming mushy.</li>
                <li>Optional Protein: If using cooked meat or shrimp, gently fold them into the rice during the last few minutes of cooking, allowing them to heat through.</li>
                <li>Serve: Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Garnish with sliced onions and chopped cilantro or parsley, if desired. Serve hot as a main dish or as a side dish alongside your favorite protein.</li>
                <p>Enjoy your homemade Jollof rice, a delicious and comforting West African classic!</p>
