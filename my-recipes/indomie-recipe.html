            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil Water: Bring a pot of water to a boil. The amount of water depends on how soupy you want your noodles to be. Generally, about 2 cups of water per packet of noodles works well.</li>
                <li>Cook Noodles: Once the water is boiling, add the Indomie noodles to the pot. Let them cook for about 3 minutes, or until they are soft but still have a slight chewiness to them. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Add Seasoning: While the noodles are cooking, open the seasoning packets that come with the Indomie noodles. There are usually two packets: one for seasoning powder and another for chili sauce or oil. Add these to the noodles once they are cooked.</li>
                <li>Mix Well: Using chopsticks or a fork, mix the seasoning into the noodles until they are well-coated and the flavors are evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Optional Toppings: If you're adding any toppings such as vegetables or protein, now is the time to do so. You can either add them directly to the pot and let them cook with the noodles for a few minutes, or you can stir-fry or boil them separately and then add them to the noodles.</li>
                <li>Serve: Once everything is mixed and cooked to your liking, turn off the heat and transfer the noodles to a bowl. Top with any additional garnishes such as fried shallots, chopped green onions, or a fried egg. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
                <p>Feel free to customize the recipe based on your preferences and available ingredients. Indomie noodles are versatile and can be enjoyed in many different ways!</p>
