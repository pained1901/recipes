            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare Ingredients: Ensure that all ingredients are chopped, diced, and prepared before starting to cook.</li>
                <li>Heat Oil: Heat vegetable oil or sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Scramble Eggs: Once the oil is hot, pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. Allow them to cook for a minute or two without stirring to let them set slightly, then gently scramble them with a spatula until they are cooked through. Remove the scrambled eggs from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
                <li>Saute Aromatics: In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes until they become fragrant and slightly softened.</li>
                <li>Add Vegetables: Add the mixed vegetables to the skillet. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until they are tender-crisp.</li>
                <li>Add Protein: Add the cooked protein of your choice (chicken, shrimp, ham, tofu, etc.) to the skillet. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until the protein is heated through.</li>
                <li>Add Rice: Add the cooked rice to the skillet. Break up any clumps of rice with a spatula and stir-fry with the vegetables and protein until well combined.</li>
                <li>Seasoning: Drizzle soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to evenly distribute the seasoning throughout the fried rice.</li>
                <li>Incorporate Eggs: Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet with the fried rice. Gently fold them into the rice until evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Finish and Serve: Continue to stir-fry the fried rice for another 2-3 minutes until everything is heated through and well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Optionally, garnish with sliced green onions for added flavor and color.</li>
                <li>Serve: Transfer the fried rice to serving plates or bowls. Enjoy hot as a delicious main dish or as a side dish with your favorite Asian-inspired meal.</li>
                <li></li>
